    <h1>Halli Orme</h1><img src="I-card Picture.jpg" alt="Image of me">
    <p>Hello everyone! My name is Halli. I love to play basketball and be outside. I also like to read books, and draw pictures. I have always been interested in computers and am taking this class to see if this is for me.</p>
    <p>My favorite scripture is Alma 48:17, and it talks about if we all had faith like moroni than the devil would have no power over us. This makes my motivated to not let Satan win and to keep trying.</p>
