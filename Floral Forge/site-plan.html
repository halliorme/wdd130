Water may not be our concern anymore, but we advise you to still use cation. Inside decorations can still cause hardship. Your plant will not die but if not used with proper precaution your house might pay. Be careful when placing them around breakable objects. Scratching on smooth surfaces can be a concern and we strongly advice you to look into our tabletop protecters. Be mindful of little children nocking them over, this may cause severe injury. Again, even though are products are made to withstand harsh conditions, they are still prone to erosion. They are not indestructible and can still be damaged. Following the proper rules of metal objects will make these concerns disappear.
